== OPEN NEW MARKETS ==

Enter new markets in months, not years. With pre-established local acquirers and selling entities around the world, Digital River helps you accelerate time to market and ignite your global sales in over 200 countries.

== OPTIMIZE WITH GREAT LOCAL EXPERIENCES ==

Where most payment processors offer a suboptimal cross-border model, Digital River gives you the onshore advantage of local acquiring. Unlike cross-border models, we help you offer the right local payment methods, language and currency, and ensure that your customers don’t get hit with foreign transaction fees. We do all this by leveraging the 20 local acquirers and 9 selling entities we’ve established around the world. As a result, you see higher authorization rates, lower cart abandonment, and greater overall customer experiences.

== GROW YOUR REVENUE ==

By giving you the onshore advantage over cross-border processing, you can increase authorization rates by 8-12%. And beyond that, we further optimize your revenue by using machine learning to find the optimal route for transactions. By combining machine learning with the industry’s most sophisticated billing technology and deep acquirer network, we can determine where and when to route a transaction for optimal success. And we retry billing attempts to further reduce your decline rates.

== SHIELD YOUR BUSINESS FROM RISK ==

Avoid fatal fines, litigation, and damage to your brand’s reputation by staying compliant with ever-changing tax and data privacy regulations. Worried about filing VAT taxes to multiple tax authorities? We do that for you. Worried about staying compliant with GDPR, PSD2 and other consumer protection regulations? We manage that for you. And we do all this through our unique merchant and seller of record business model.
